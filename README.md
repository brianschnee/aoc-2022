# Advent of Code - 2022

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022, written in TypeScript.

To run typescript code, `cd` into a day's directory, the typescript folder, then execute `deno run --allow-read <file name>.ts`

To run go code, `cd` into a day's directory, the go's folder, then execute `go run main.go`

### Directory Outline

```
|_ Day <number>
   |_ input.txt -> provided input
   |_ go
      |_ main.go -> go solutions for parts a and b
   |_ typescript
      |_ a.ts -> typescript part a solution
      |_ b.ts -> typescript part b solution
```
